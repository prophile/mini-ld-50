      You are in an entrance hallway. The walls, floor and ceilings are grey and
      brown. The lens flare from an open window hurts your eyes slightly.

      You are facing a giant brick wall. It would be a solid piece of

      You are sprinting across an open field, and seriously regretting that decision. Bullets whizz past you on all sides. The once beautiful green field has been reduced to a grey and brown mush of dead grass and mud.
      <br>There is a huge wall to the west, a crashed helicopter to the north, a warehouse to the east and a forest to the south.
