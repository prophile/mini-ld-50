      You are in an entrance hallway. The walls, floor and ceilings are grey and
      brown. The lens flare from an open window hurts your eyes slightly. There
      is an exit to the south.

      You are facing a giant brick wall. It would be a solid piece of
      architecture if not for the layers of muck, which make it a sort of
      grey-brown colour.

      It is a small health pack. One wonders why war is even necessary with
      these kinds of medical miracles.
